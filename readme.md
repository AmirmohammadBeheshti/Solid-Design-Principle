This repository demonstrates the implementation of the five SOLID design principles in object-oriented programming: **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**, **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**, and **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**.

## Overview

SOLID principles are fundamental concepts in software development that help in creating maintainable, scalable, and efficient code. Here's a brief explanation of each principle:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should have only one job or responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a system without modifying its source code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality of the program.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use. Instead of having one large interface, it's better to have smaller, specific interfaces.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
